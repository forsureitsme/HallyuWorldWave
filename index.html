		</h4>
		<hr>
		<center><small>This page is just to say it's kind of coming soon...</small></center>
		<p>
		  	It's a rythm game still in development. It will be available to Windows, Mac OS and Linux.<br>
			It's based in the worldwide famous game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG6ySTlUrHk" target="_blank">Pump It Up</a>, but it'll only have songs from the korean wave.
		</p>
		<p>
			This game needs a lot of <small><s>work</s></small> love. It's looking for:
			<ul>
				<li>A interface designer. The one it have right now was made by someone who's not creative</li>
				<li>LUA developers (preferably with knowledge about Stepmania engine)</li>
				<li>Players to test interface and gameplay, and give reviews about the whole game</li>
				<li>Translator for whichever language the community ask for/you're willing to do</li>
				<li>A fanbase, eh</li>
				<li>

					</form>
				</li>
			</ul>

			Be aware that it's not going to be release early with any kind of unfinished stuff, because I prefer you guys to be a little disappointed at first and then become hyped later, rather than get disappointed all the way in the begining and then never want to see the name of this game again.<br>
			<br>
			Please, understand.
