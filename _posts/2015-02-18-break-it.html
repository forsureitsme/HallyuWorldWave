This is a creative thing I though by looking at some Rock Band videos. Making the noteskin break in multiple parts is indeed an interesting effect, even better when you take in account that most of the things you step with your foot are expected to break.

The output is pretty cool, although it's not smooth as in Rock Band noteskin.
