Coming back from hiatus I am here again to tell you guys Hallyu World Wave is back again to the active. Like the first time, I started from _fallback theme, but then felt it was unecessary to recreate the wheel. So I took luizsan's Delta theme as base.
Unlike the first time, I couldn't navigate well through ScreenSelectMusic.
<br><br>
The reason?<br>
<a href="http://www.stepmania.com/forums/general-stepmania/show/1302" target="_blank">Stepmania 5 Beta 4 have theme error reporting on screen</a>.<br>
The "problem" was:<br>
Delta theme was not really that broken, it was just trying to get steps for players that are not enabled.
<br><br>
Took me two days to fix that and the theme was now even faster.
I though in re-releasing the Delta V3 for those who wanted to have the theme working in the latest Stepmania build, but I still remember the ~basic Delta theme recolor~ rampage, so I'll stick with it myself and just go from here.
